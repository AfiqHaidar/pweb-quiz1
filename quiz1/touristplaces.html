            <h4>1. Masjid Agung Banten</h4>

            <p>Masjid Agung Banten is one of Indonesia's oldest mosques, steeped in historical significance. Located in Banten Lama, Serang City, Banten Province, Indonesia, it stands as one of the few remaining relics of the ancient city of Banten—a thriving trade center in Indonesia—following the fall of the Demak Sultanate in the mid-16th century.[3]:102</p>

<p>The mosque was first built in 1556 by Sultan Maulana Hasanuddin (1552-1570), the first sultan of the Banten Sultanate.[4]:114 He was the eldest son of Sunan Gunung Jati. Each day, the mosque is visited by pilgrims not only from Banten and West Java but also from various regions across Java. The mosque is known for its distinctive tower, resembling a lighthouse.</p>

            <h4>2. Keraton Kaibon</h4>

            <p>Keraton Kaibon was established by Sultan Syafiuddin during his reign over the Banten Sultanate from 1809 to 1815. He built Keraton Kaibon as a residence for his mother, and the name of the palace itself means "a mother's love."[1] Sultan Syafiuddin's mother was Queen Aisyah. The construction of Keraton Kaibon was primarily intended as a home for his mother, located near the Keraton Surosowan, which served as the center of the Banten Sultanate's administration. This proximity facilitated meetings between Sultan Syafiuddin and his mother, as he ascended the throne of Banten at the age of 5. Keraton Kaibon faced west and had a front portion connected to a canal leading north, which was the location of Keraton Surosowan.[2]</p>

<p>Today, only ruins remain of Keraton Kaibon, alongside a large tree and a canal. According to local residents, it was once a magnificent palace. However, in 1832, the Dutch destroyed it during conflicts with the Banten Sultanate.</p>
        <h4>3. Taman Nasional Ujung Kulon</h4>

        <p>Ujung Kulon National Park is located on the Ujung Kulon Peninsula, the westernmost part of Java Island, Indonesia. Originally, the national park encompassed the Krakatau region and several small islands nearby, including Handeuleum Island, Peucang Island, and Panaitan Island. The park covers an area of approximately 122,956 hectares (443 square kilometers), including both land and sea areas, stretching from the Ujung Kulon Peninsula to the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>Ujung Kulon is Indonesia's oldest national park and was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1991 due to its extensive protected forest area. It is currently home to around 50 to 60 rhinoceroses in their natural habitat.</p>

<p>Initially, Ujung Kulon was used for agriculture at various times until it was completely depopulated and turned into a forest again when Mount Krakatau erupted on August 27, 1883.</p>

<p>Entrance tickets to the national park can be obtained at the Ujung Kulon National Park office in Labuan or at the Tamanjaya post. Accommodation facilities are available in the villages of Tamanjaya, Handeuleum Island, and Peucang Island.</p>

<p>To enhance the management capacity of Ujung Kulon National Park as a UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site, UNESCO has provided financial support and technical assistance.</p>
